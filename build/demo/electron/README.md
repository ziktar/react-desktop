## How to use

First, enter the folder:

```cd demo/electron```

Install the libraries:

```npm i``` or ```yarn``` (if you have been installed it)

Build once:

```npm run build```

Then start the server:

```npm run watch```

Open another console at the same folder, and run this command to start the Electron process:

```npm start```

That's it!
